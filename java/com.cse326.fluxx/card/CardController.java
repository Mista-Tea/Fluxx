/**
 * Created by Thomas on 4/24/2015.
 *
 * The card controller handles all of the cards in the game in a list format.
 * Each list of cards can be drawn from and discarded to; this will mainly be used for drawing from the Deck and discarding to the discard pile.
 * Card lists also have a designated owner, either one of the players or the game board.
 * Each list can also be hidden, so only the owner of that list of cards is able to view the contents of the list but all players can know the size of each list.
