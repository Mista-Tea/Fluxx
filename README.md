# Project Overview
Fluxx is a simple card game that can be played with many people. Because making a computer based version of Fluxx would not do well without online multiplayer or a sufficiently advanced computer AI, a mobile version of the game would be much easier to implement and would create an overall more satisfying product. We propose to make an Android app version of Fluxx capable of local multiplayer, in addition, if time allows, we also plan to make an iOS version of Fluxx that is also capable of multiplayer and, once again if time allows, allow the Android and iOS versions to play with each other.

The minimum scope of the project is to create an Android version of Fluxx capable of local multiplayer. The maximum scope is to create Android and iOS versions that are capable of cross platform local multiplayer. The objectives are simple: make a working Android Fluxx app, and make that app capable of local multiplayer. Optional objectives are: create an iOS version, make that version capable of local multiplayer, and make the Android and iOS versions able to play with each other.
